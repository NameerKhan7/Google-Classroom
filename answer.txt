The Book Inventory System is a basic program developed using C++. It employs object-oriented programming principles to manage a collection of books. The core entities are the Book class, representing individual books with attributes like title, author, genre, and quantity in stock. The BookInventory class is responsible for storing a vector of books and offers various functionalities. Users can add new books to the inventory with the addBook method, search for a book by its title using searchBookByTitle, update the quantity of a book through updateBookQuantity, and display all books stored in the inventory with the displayAllBooks function. This simple system allows users to maintain a record of books, find information about specific books, and manage their stock levels efficiently.
